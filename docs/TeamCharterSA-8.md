These are the terms of group conduct and cooperation that we agree on as a team.



**Participation** : We agree to....

equally contribute to the team projects. Everybody is required to make a certain amount of technical contribution, but team members will leverage their own strengths on an as needed basis.  Everybody will put in on average the same amount of hours per week toward the two team projects. We each agree to spend about 6 hours per week on team projects, depending on other deliverables and course obligations. Every iteration will have a project leader, which will rotate. Tasks will be created collectively and team members will volunteer for them. Tasks will be estimated by the team. Each person will keep track of his/her hours worked in each week.



**Communication** : We agree to...

respond to team emails, team messages, review requests, and information requests from other team members within 24 hours. We will keep each other abreast of any developments and of our progress. We won&#39;t wait until the team meeting to deal with issues, share information, or synchronize work. We will use Trello to manage our task backlog and track task status.



**Meetings** : We agree to....

meet twice every week for an hour. Team members will be punctual so that we don&#39;t  waste precious time waiting for each other. Every meeting will have an assigned moderator who will manage the time and the agenda. The moderator will prepare the agenda. This role will be rotated. If somebody cannot be present in person, he/she will notify the moderator and will make every effort to participate remotely. We will start each meeting with kudos, where each team member will briefly list important recent contributions by others.



**Conduct** : We agree to...

respect each other&#39;s opinions and listen to each other. Flaming will not be allowed in written communication or during meetings. We will try to reach consensus when possible. We agree that giving credit is as important as taking credit. We will give credit when credit is due. We will not take credit for someone else&#39;s work. We will use constructive criticism.



**Dealing with Conflicts** : We agree to...

to use the following process to deal with conflicts. Majority rules in general. Project leader will break any ties by having a double vote if needed. Moderator arbitrates to resolve disagreements during meetings, and can park issues to be discussed later. If parties in conflict cannot reconcile within a week, they will first consult with their TA, who can escalate the situation to the instructors.

If a team member feels that another team member is not pulling his/her weight or is being unreasonable, the team should have an open discussion about the issue. If the situation does not improve within a week or two, the team can escalate the situation to the TA or to the instructors.



**Deadlines** : We agree to...

complete and submit assigned work for a team deliverable at least two days in advance of the deliverable due date so that the team can review and aggregate the work in time. A designated team member will review the final submission before submitting a deliverable. This role will be rotated.
